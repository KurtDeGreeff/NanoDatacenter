# Known Limitations

Because Nano is based on .NET Core and the full framework, there are some known limitations. 

These features will not run at this time:

* Active Directory Domain controller
* Remote Desktop Server
* PowerShell Web Access

It is a safe bet that you also cannot use Nano to run:

* Sharepoint
* Microsoft Exchange
* System Center products

Where a feature or service was able to be installed on a Nano server, I have not verified or tested every single part. It is possible that even though Nano may support something, there may be subtle differences.
