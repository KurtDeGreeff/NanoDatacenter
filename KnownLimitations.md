# Known Limitations

Because Nano is based on .NET Core and the full framework, there are some known limitations. 

I know that these features will not run at this time so I'm not even going to include them in my demonstrations:

* Active Directory Domain controller
* Remote Desktop Server
* PowerShell Web Access

It is a safe (and hopefully obvious) bet that you also cannot use Nano server to run:

* Sharepoint
* Microsoft Exchange
* System Center products

Where a feature or service was able to be installed on a Nano server, I have not verified or tested every single part. It is possible that even though Nano may support something, there may be subtle differences. It is also possible that some future update to .NET Core or refactoring of an application or feature so that it will be supported on a Nano server.
